# Overview of the project 

## Background

Improbable Beef, a startup company, is working with Rosa, a bioresearcher, to identify bacteria that could potentially be used to make synthetic beef.  Rosa has hypothesized that certain human bellybutton bacterial species could potentially be ideal candidates.  To investigate the bacteria found in various bellybuttons, volunteers had their bellybuttons swabbed.  Those swabs were analyzed and a file of the mock sample results and subject metadata was provided.   


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop an interactive website that allows test subjects to view their individual results.  Each subject is identified by ID number and this allows individual results to be viewed on the website.

If any species of bacteria are useful in creating synthetic beef, the test subjects may be able to assist Improbable Beef with production.


# Results


## Website


When the website initially loads, the data for the first test subject, identified as 940, are displayed.  Each subject can then select his or her number in the dropdown menu.  The data on the website then updates.  

The individual’s demographic information including ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type (innie or outie), and washing frequency are shown.  A bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial cultures found, a gauge chart shows the belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart shows all cultures found in the sample.

## Customizations¬¬


To enhance the look, feel, and usefulness of the website, a number of customizations were added.  

Under each visualization, text was added to help the subject understand what is shown in the chart.  For example, in the bubble chart, the text explains that the larger the bubble and the higher the bubble on the chart, the higher the concentration for that bacterium.  The text also lets subjects know that hovering over an individual bubble will show them details for that specific species including concentration, ID number, and species name.

Additionally, text was added to explain the purpose of the site and to instruct users how to use it.

An image from Unsplash was added as a background for the Jumbotron.  The image of a scientist examining petri dishes was designed to enhance the scientific feel of the site.


# Summary


There are some additional enhancements that could be made to the website.

Since some of the data on the website include personal and medical information, it is important to make sure that there’s a full understanding of how this data should be displayed and utilized.  Given that this is a mock dataset, the website doesn’t require any sort of authentication.  If, however, it was real individual data, additional verification should take place to ensure that an individual only has access to his or her data.

Additionally, as prime species are identified for synthetic beef, the website should be updated to inform subjects of which species are candidates and the next steps in the process.

It was a pleasure to be involved in this project and to I appreciate being able to help develop the code and website.  If I may be of further assistance as the project continues to unfold, please reach out.
